# ADVANCED NHL STATS

Official NHL website offers limited amount of statistics.Onitial idea of this project is to find volume of official game stats offered for professionals and TV crews. It turns out We can get much more stats and that's for free. 

## Stats available in official game reviews on NHL.com website
Yes, goals, assists, penalties, shots on goal, giveaways, takeaways, faceoff percentage, plus-minus are available. 

## Stats not available in official game reviews
But missed and blocked shots, exact number of faceoffs won or lost, penalty against data are not there. Meanwhile I hear that all the time from Josh and Razor. This app allows to view this info. Also, I added charts where penalties were committed and where goals were scored. Future plan is to allow to view shots by player. So that I will kmow who shoots from which position. Also, I plan to show not just plus minus but how many plussses and minusses were there. It is frequent that leading scorers are same people who are scored on.

Live page is approved at https://johnpaulgeorgeringo.github.io/MovieReviews/. But it does not work as planned. It is the result of a Microsoft setting.

      I raised her with her mother. I tought her read Russian language when she was less than two years old. I tought her English when she was less than five years old. 
      I brought her to the United States from rural area in Russia where she was born. She abandoned me. She refused to get in touch with me. She called me names last time I talked to her.</h2>
